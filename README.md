# Art Marks

An app to help organize and categorize bookmarks with an easier to navigate UI! Add extra details to each book mark. Is it an article? Video? Tutorial? For the time being only one category is available but stretch goals would be to add extra functionality to create and list multiple tabs for different topics (**examples:** cooking, health, school).

### Current Examples
A small sampling from my own massive and terribly disorganized bookmarks in which I forget 75% of what I bookmark anyway. I decided to simply list out some art programs and courses I find interesting and plan to try out some time before I grow old and die.

### Stretch Goals
As mentioned above, have functionality to add extra categories for different topics and areas of interest. Like all the interesting coding articles and tutorials I also forget I keep saving. Recipes I never wind up touching and websites I find inspiring in one way or another
## Technologies Used

- React
- Ruby on Rails
- PostGresSQL

### Challenges
For the first three or so days I attempted to use a headless CMS calling CosmicJS as a way to try something new. Unfortunately I couldn't quite get it to correctly connect it through fetch and had to ultimately scrap it for the time being. In the future when I get a handle on it I plan on returning to impliment it.
